INSTALL: import using “import script” button inside midi remote section.

IMPORTANT: factory preset for BCR2000 is absolute mode, and this cause stutter moving on knobs: i used relative mode. 
BCR2000 need to be configured manually prior to use this script:
•	all knobs need to be in “rel1” mode
•	all buttons “toggle off” mode
or you can load attached .bcr preset (easy done with BC MANAGER https://mountainutilities.eu/bcmanager).


This is the default CC assignement to match midi remote script:
